# RISD-Web-Design-Portfolio

My final project for a 2-week web design course taken at RISD in the summer of 2014.

This website was originally designed to host my photography and videography portfolio.

### Known Issues:

- Obviously fairly rudimentary.
- Responsive web design is virtually non-existant.
